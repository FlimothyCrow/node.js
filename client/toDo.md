-   build upvote component
    -   call it from Meme.js component
    -   it displays meme ups and downs from the passed prop
-   fetch and put into use state data in MemePage to render image
    {/_ render comments _/}
    {/_ render new comment form _/}
    nav bar
-   might have to rework updoot response - do it by state and not use database response?
